# Cholesky-Decomposition
This repo looks into how Cholesky decomposition helps create linked random variables, a method often used in finance math and statistical models. It begins with the math basics of covariance and correlation matrices showing how to break them down using the Cholesky-Banachiewicz method. We use Python to run simulations of asset price paths assuming they follow a random walk. The simulated correlation matrix is asymptotically the same as the historical one: $C^{sim}\underset{n\to\infty}{\sim}C^{hist}$, where $n$ is the number of days(simulations) in the simulations set.
